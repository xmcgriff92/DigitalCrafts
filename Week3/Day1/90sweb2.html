        <p>For years players have loved the simple and exciting "Bop It, Twist It, Pull It" actions featured in this iconic electronic Bop It! game. Players can face-off in a multiplayer game with the pass and play feature or beat their best in solo mode. The game unit has 3 different volume settings and announces the high score at the start of each solo game. It's a great game to bring to parties and get-togethers with family and friends.
